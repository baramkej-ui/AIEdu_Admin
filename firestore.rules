/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EduQuiz Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-centric security model with role-based access control.
 * Users can only manage their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * Problem documents are publicly readable but only writable by admins or teachers.
 * Student progress is restricted so students can only modify their own progress records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /problems/{problemId}: Stores quiz problems.
 * - /studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Stores student progress records, with composite IDs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users are not allowed to list all users. Only `get` is allowed for individual profiles.
 * - Public read access is granted to the 'problems' collection.
 * - All write operations are protected by authentication and authorization checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User roles are stored directly in the `/users/{userId}` document to simplify authorization checks.
